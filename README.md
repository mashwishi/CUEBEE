> If you have questions related to Geyser and FloodGate, please contact [Geyser](https://discord.gg/geysermc), This project is created for set-up tutorial only. **You'll be on your own when you try to add plugins and update to higher version.**


## Getting Started
This is how you will set-up and host your cross-version and cross-platform Minecaft Server on Windows or Hosting Services.


### Requirements

- Java Version 16 (Important)
- Atleast 5GB of Ram (Minimum for 1.17.x)
- Quad-Core CPU/Processor or higher (4 Cores)

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mashwishi/CUEBEE.git
   ```
2. Configure run.bat and modify `5G` to your desire ram.
   ```bat
    :: IGNORE THIS IF YOU'RE NOT SELF-HOSTING, KINDLY DON'T INCLUDE THIS FILE!
    java -Xmx5G -Xms5G -jar paper.jar nogui
    PAUSE
   ```
3. After that kindly run `start.bat` file. This will start your minecraft server
4. If the server prints `Done!` to the console kindly type `Stop` and hit enter
5. Once your server is closed, Navigate to `plugins` folder and open `floddgate`
6. Copy the `key.pem` file and go back to `plugins` folder open `geyser` folder
7. Paste the `key.pem` file to `geyser` folder
8. To edit the MOTD of your Bedrock Server open `config.yml` at `geyser` folder
   ```yml
    #Rename the motd1, motd2 and server-name strings
    motd1: "Cuebee"
    motd2: "A Java & Bedrock Server"
    server-name: "Cuebee"
   ```
9. Once every thing is done you can now start your service again to your panel or `start.bat` for self-hosting

### Reminders:

- If you are using hosting services and not self-hosting do not include the `server.properties` and `start.bat` since `server.properties` will be generated by your host and `start.bat` is not the way to start your minecraft server on hosting services look for `start` button to your panel to start your server in a hosting service.
